* ...


## Tokenizer

* write tokenizer


## I/O

### Data
* get the sat-solver to accept:
    * files given by command-line
    * single sat instances (boolean formula)
        feed by command line

### Help
* write a useful Help menu

### Web server
* port number were to start the solver



## Web interface
